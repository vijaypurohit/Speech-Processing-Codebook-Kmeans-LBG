-----------------------------------------------------
K-Means step by step procedure (codebook size, k = 8 and universe size, M):
1. Initialize m=0 and the codebook with random vectors from the universe. (Now you codebook has k vectors of 12 values each.
2. for each of the vector in universe, assign it to the region based on nearest neighbor rule.
3. calculate the total distortion, say dist, of all the regions. Take the average distortion, say av_dist = dist/M . (Use Tokhura distance)
4. Calculate the centroid of each region and update the centroid for every region.
5. m = m+1;
6. perform the steps 2,3,4 till abs(distortion - dist) > delta. 
distortion is the previous iteration distortion and dist is the current one. 
(you can take delta value either 0.0001 or 0.00001)
-------------------------------------------------------
LBG step by step procedure (codebook size, k = 8 and universe size, M):
1. Initialize the codebook with a single vector which is the centroid of the universe. (Now you codebook has 1 vector of 12 values).
Following steps are repeated until the size of codebook=k.
2. Double the size of codebook by following below step for each codebook entry:
a) one vector will be obtained by Yi = Yi(1+epsilon)
b) other vector will be obtained by Yi = Yi(1-epsilon)
i ranges from 1 to p=12. (take epsilon = 0.03)
3. Use k-means algorithm to get the best set of the centroids for split codebook (double of the size of previous step codebook).
